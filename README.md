# AFIncrementalStore

**This project has been discontinued, and is no longer being maintained as an official AFNetworking extension.**

AFIncrementalStore was an [`NSIncrementalStore`](http://nshipster.com/nsincrementalstore/) subclass that used [AFNetworking](https://github.com/afnetworking/afnetworking) to automatically request resources as properties and relationships were needed.

Source code is still available for reference on the [`development` branch](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFIncrementalStore/tree/development). Projects currently using AFIncrementalStore are encouraged to either fork this branch or migrate to another persistence solution.
