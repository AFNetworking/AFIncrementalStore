# AFIncrementalStore
**Core Data Persistence with AFNetworking, Done Right**

> _This is still in early stages of development, so proceed with caution when using this in a production application. Any bug reports, feature requests, or general feedback at this point would be greatly appreciated._

**A lot of us have been burned by Core Data + REST frameworks in the past.**  
**I can promise you that this is unlike anything you've seen before.**

AFIncrementalStore is an [`NSIncrementalStore`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSIncrementalStore_Class/Reference/NSIncrementalStore.html) subclass that uses [AFNetworking](https://github.com/afnetworking/afnetworking) to automatically request resources as properties and relationships are needed. I had noticed `NSIncrementalStore` in the iOS 5 docs a while ago, but it was [this article](http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsincrementalstore-the-future-of-web-services-in-ios-mac-os-x/) that got me to realize how unbelievably cool it was.

**Weighing in at just over 300 LOC, AFIncrementalStore is something you can get your head around.** Integrating it into your project couldn't be easier--just swap out your `NSPersistentStore` for it. No monkey-patching, no extra properties on your models.

The only thing you need to do is tell `AFIncrementalStore` how to map Core Data to an HTTP client. These methods are defined in the `AFIncrementalStoreHTTPClient` protocol:

```objective-c
- (id)representationOrArrayOfRepresentationsFromResponseObject:(id)responseObject;

- (NSString *)resourceIdentifierForRepresentation:(NSDictionary *)representation
                                         ofEntity:(NSEntityDescription *)entity;

- (NSDictionary *)propertyValuesForRepresentation:(NSDictionary *)representation
                                         ofEntity:(NSEntityDescription *)entity
                                     fromResponse:(NSHTTPURLResponse *)response;

- (NSURLRequest *)requestForFetchRequest:(NSFetchRequest *)fetchRequest
                             withContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context;

- (NSURLRequest *)requestWithMethod:(NSString *)method
                pathForObjectWithID:(NSManagedObjectID *)objectID
                        withContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context;

- (NSURLRequest *)requestWithMethod:(NSString *)method
                pathForRelationship:(NSRelationshipDescription *)relationship
                    forObjectWithID:(NSManagedObjectID *)objectID
                        withContext:(NSManagedObjectContext *)context;
```

Don't worry if this looks like a lot of work--if your web service is RESTful, `AFRESTClient` does a lot of the heavy lifting for you. If your target web service is SOAP, RPC, or kinda ad-hoc, you can easily use these protocol methods to get everything hooked up.

## Getting Started

Check out the example project included in the repository. It's a simple demonstration of an app that uses Core Data with `AFIncrementalStore` to communicate with an API for faulted properties and relationships. Note that there are no explicit network requests being made in the app--it's all done automatically by Core Data.
Don't forget to pull down AFNetworking with `git submodule init && git submodule update` if you want to run the example. 

## Requirements

AFIncrementalStore requires [iOS 4.0](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniPhoneOS/Articles/iPhoneOS4.html) and above, or [Mac OS 10.6](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#releasenotes/MacOSX/WhatsNewInOSX/Articles/MacOSX10_6.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008898-SW7) ([64-bit with modern Cocoa runtime](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtVersionsPlatforms.html)) and above, as well as [AFNetworking](https://github.com/afnetworking/afnetworking) 0.9 or higher.

## Next Steps

This project is just getting started. Next up for `AFIncrementalStore` are the following:

- Full Documentation
- Additional example projects
- POST to server when creating new managed objects
- Automatic `If-Modified-Since` & `If-Match` headers based on last request of resources.
- Default transformations for fetch request offset / limit to pagination parameters
- Examples of other API adapters (e.g. RPC, SOAP, ad-hoc)
