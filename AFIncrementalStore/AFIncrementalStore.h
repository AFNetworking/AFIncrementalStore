/**
 `AFIncrementalStore` is an abstract subclass of `NSIncrementalStore`, designed to allow you to load and save data incrementally to and from a one or more web services.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 ### Methods to Override
 
 In a subclass of `AFIncrementalStore`, you _must_ override the following methods to provide behavior appropriate for your store:
    
    - `+type`
    - `+model`
 
 Additionally, all `NSPersistentStore` subclasses, and thus all `AFIncrementalStore` subclasses must do `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator +registerStoreClass:forStoreType:` in order to be created by `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator -addPersistentStoreWithType:configuration:URL:options:error:`. It is recommended that subclasses register themselves in their own `+initialize` method.
 
 Optionally, `AFIncrementalStore` subclasses can override the following methods:
 
    - `-executeFetchRequest:withContext:error:`
    - `-executeSaveChangesRequest:withContext:error:`

 ### Methods Not To Be Overridden
 
 Subclasses should not override `-executeRequest:withContext:error`. Instead, override `-executeFetchRequest:withContext:error:` or `-executeSaveChangesRequest:withContext:error:`, which are called by `-executeRequest:withContext:error` depending on the type of persistent store request.

/** 
 There is a bug in Core Data wherein managed object IDs whose reference object is a string beginning with a digit will incorrectly strip any subsequent non-numeric characters from the reference object. This breaks any functionality related to URI representations of the managed object ID, and likely other methods as well. For example, an object ID with a reference object of @"123ABC" would generate one with a URI represenation `coredata://store-UUID/Entity/123`, rather than the expected `coredata://store-UUID/Entity/123ABC`. As a fix, rather than resource identifiers being used directly as reference objects, they are prepended with a non-numeric constant first.
 
 Thus, in order to get the resource identifier of a managed object's reference object, you must use the function `AFResourceIdentifierFromReferenceObject()`.
    
 See https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFIncrementalStore/issues/82 for more details.
